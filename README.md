# üß™ Basic Cisco Router and Switch Configuration Lab (Packet Tracer)

This project was completed as part of a cybersecurity training fellowship. The goal was to simulate a small business network using Cisco Packet Tracer, configure a router and two switches with secure remote access, and verify device-to-device connectivity using CLI tools. All configurations and IP assignments were implemented manually and tested for proper functionality.

## üéØ Lab Objectives

- Build a network using a Cisco 2911 router, two 2960 switches, and four PCs
- Configure interfaces, IP addresses, and default gateways
- Apply basic security to all devices (console, VTY, AUX passwords)
- Enable remote management via VLAN 1 on both switches
- Verify connectivity using CLI commands and Packet Tracer tools

## ‚úÖ Verification & Troubleshooting Commands

These are included across the `.txt` files and should be used in the CLI to validate connectivity:

| Command                      | Purpose                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ping [IP_ADDRESS]`         | Test connectivity between PCs, router, switches |
| `show ip interface brief`   | Verify IP address and interface status           |
| `show running-config`       | View active configuration                        |
| `show interfaces status`    | Check switch port status                         |
| `show vlan brief`           | See VLAN assignment and port mapping             |
| `show clock`                | Display system clock (timezone config test)      |
| `show mac address-table`    | Display MAC learning status on switches          |
